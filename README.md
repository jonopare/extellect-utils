# Extellect Utilities
A free library of utility classes that (at the time of writing) I felt were missing from the major libraries such as Microsoft's .NET Framework, Spring.NET and log4net.
As time went on, the library grew. These types are intended to increase your productivity by letting you reuse something that somebody else has already written and hopefully unit tested

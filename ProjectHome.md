A free library of helpful classes that (at the time of writing) I feel are missing from the major libraries such as Microsoft's .NET Framework, Spring.NET and log4net.

These types are intended to increase your productivity by letting you reuse something that somebody else has already written and unit tested.

Please give me any feedback you might have; negative is welcomed as much as positive at this stage!
